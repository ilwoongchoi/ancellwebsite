          defense system comprising many biological structures and processes
          within an organism that protects against disease. ... </span></p>

      <h1> <span style="color: #006600;" id="h2">What are the Parts of the
          Immune System? </span></h1>
      <span style="color: #006600;"> </span>
      <p><span style="color: #006600;"> Many cells and organs work together to
          protect the body. White blood cells, also called leukocytes, play an
          important role in the immune system. Some types of white blood cells,
          called phagocytes, chew up invading organisms. Others, called
          lymphocytes, help the body remember the invaders and destroy them. </span></p>
      <span style="color: #006600;"> </span>
      <p><span style="color: #006600;"> One type of phagocyte is the neutrophil,
          which fights bacteria. When someone might have bacterial infection,
          doctors can order a blood test to see if it caused the body to have
          lots of neutrophils. Other types of phagocytes do their own jobs to
          make sure that the body responds to invaders. </span></p>
      <span style="color: #006600;"> </span>
      <p><span style="color: #006600;"> The two kinds of lymphocytes are B
          lymphocytes and T lymphocytes. Lymphocytes start out in the bone
          marrow and either stay there and mature into B cells, or go to the
          thymus gland to mature into T cells. B lymphocytes are like the body's
          military intelligence system they find their targets and send defenses
          to lock onto them. T cells are like the soldiers they destroy the
          invaders that the intelligence system finds. </span></p>

          your immune system and therefore your longevity. These include Zinc,
          Vitamin C, DHEA, fish oils, and Reishi mushrooms, among others. As you
          explore these options, remember, just because you’ve been alive
          longer, doesn’t mean you have to passively accept declining immune
          function. In fact, building your immune system is the front line of
          the Revolution Against Aging and Death. </span></p>
